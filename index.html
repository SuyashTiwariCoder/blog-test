    <h1>Is Music important for Coding ?</h1>
    <p>Well , according to me it is very personal choice to hear music during coding . As I am not an musician so i find productivity during sessions with music on . But if someone knows the lyrics then its hard for him to get away from it . As we see in level zero lectures Tanay sir also got into singing music and he cant get through it .  </p>

    <h2>Which genre to listen ?</h2>
    <p>Well , I am a hiphop fan . So I prefer to listen hiphop music for coding sessions . But I will walk you through my list of other genre for productivity.  </p>
    <h3>Some Other Genre</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Instrumental</h4> <br>

            I am well aware that you know what is an Instrumental kind of music . It feels relaxing and soothing to hear Instrumental and it will 100% increase your productivity. So sometimes I listen to it and if you also want to listen this , Then you should go to youtube and search for "Instrumental music live " You will came across various videos those were live and just plug in and dive deep in to ocean .

            <p>
          Lo- Fi is a short form of Low Fidelty . Now , What does it means ?
        <br>
        It is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections of a recording or performance are audible, sometimes as a deliberate aesthetic choice . If you don't understand now also then I will explain you in simple words , that suppose you r listening a song on your car and you are struck in a traffic jam and rain is cats and dogs , So if what exact sounds do you hear at that time , first of music ofcourse , second because of traffic jam some honking sounds and third raining , Now combine all these three sound effects and listen then as a song then it is called low fidelty.
        You can search on youtube "Advait" for lo-fi music .

        <li><h4>HipHop</h4> <br>
            <img class="img"src="/images/dom-hill-0wMLZNbE8Ac-unsplash.jpg" alt="loading.." >
            <p>
          THis is my favorite genre because its flows are so fast that if you want to be distracted by singing it , you can't chase the flow .
          Fast flows can rush your adranaline to next level and make u a beast at something you are doing . Hip Hop is a genre that I find very relateable . SO you can check this genre also . Some of my recommendations are listen to rappers like Kr$na , Karma , King .
